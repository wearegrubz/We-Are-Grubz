# CA02 - Booking API Part 1

**Overview**: This project builds off last the assignment where you designed the Booking classes. You will create Parse
database to hold some fake data. You will be creating a backend API to communicate with your Parse Database.


**Submission Instructions**:
Once you've completed the required user stories for your project, take the following steps to get your project ready to
submit.

1. Push Code to Github Repository
    - If this week's assignment is starting a new project. However, if the week's assignment is a continuation of the
      last week's project, you will NOT create a new project. Copy the project files into the new repository folder and
      make an initial commit.

2. Create a README Template
    - Every submission must be accompanied by a README.md using the readme template provided with the assignment to
      demonstrate which required and optional tasks you've completed.
    - In your project repository, add a README.md file in the root directory that contains the contents of the README
      template for that assignment.
    - If the assignment is a continuation of the same project from a previous week, add the new template to the end of
      the previous README instead of creating a new file.
    - Make sure to check off the user stories you've completed.

3. GIF Walkthrough
    - Your README.md must contain a GIF walkthrough using a recording program of your choice. It should demonstrating
      how it works with the user stories completed.
    - We recommend [Kap](https://getkap.co/) for macOS, [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) for Windows,
      and [peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) for Linux.
    - [Imgur](https://imgur.com/upload) is a great service for hosting the GIF walkthrough and then linking to it from
      the README.
    - When using Imgur, you can right-click on the gif and choose "Copy Image Address" to get the correct address. Make
      sure the address has a `.gif` extension. If you end up with a url that has a `.gifv` extension, removing the `v`
      and changing this to `.gif` will ensure the gif renders on GitHub.

4. Make sure you've pushed all your latest code up to GitHub
    - To check this, you can browse your repository on GitHub on your favorite browser to make sure some of your latest
      changes are present there.

### Required Stories

- Create a Parse database your application. . ***(3 points)***
    - The names of class fields should match the names presented in the last coding assignment (this includes casing)-

    - Include sample data
- Create an endpoint for each of the major classes (Hotel, Room, User) ***(6 points)***
    - Create the required models, controllers, and services
    - Each controller should have at least 2 methods
        - Get all
        - Get by id
- Document endpoints. ***(1 point)***
    - Add to the README file the URI for each endpoint and a description (see example below)

### Stretch Stories

- Create an endpoint that allows the used to sort descending or ascending. ***(5 points)***
    - Add this by using a query string (ie, `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/product/?sort=asc`)
